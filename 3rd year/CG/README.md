## Second Assignment
An iconic example of a transformable robot in both transformation modes (robot and truck) with a trailer and the transformation sequence "truck â†’ robot".

The objectives of the second laboratory assignment are: (i) to understand and implement the architecture of an interactive graphical application; (ii) to explore the basic concepts of geometric modeling through primitive instantiation; (iii) to explore the concept of a virtual camera; (iv) to understand the differences between orthogonal projection and perspective projection; (v) to apply basic animation techniques; and (vi) to understand and implement simple collision detection techniques.

## Third Assignment

References for creating a rural landscape visited by an extraterrestrial spaceship: a typical Alentejo-style house, a cork oak tree with its bark stripped, Alentejo plains, and a 1950s-style flying saucer.

The objectives of the third laboratory assignment are: (i) to understand the basic concepts of lighting, (ii) the concepts of material, (iii) directional light sources, and spotlights, (iv) geometric modeling through primitive instantiation and polygon mesh creation, (v) to comprehend the basic principles of applying textures, and (vi) the fundamental principles of the stereoscopic camera.
