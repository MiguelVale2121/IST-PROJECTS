# University Projects Repository

Welcome to my GitHub repository! In this folder, you'll find a collection of my university projects completed over the course of three years of my academic journey.

## Overview

This repository serves as a portfolio of my academic achievements and practical skills gained during my time at university. The projects included here cover a wide range of topics, reflecting the diverse areas of study and interests pursued throughout my undergraduate program.

## Folder Structure

The repository is organized into three main directories, each corresponding to a year of my university education:

- **Year 1**: This directory contains projects from my first year of university. These early projects may demonstrate my foundational knowledge and initial progress.

- **Year 2**: Here, you'll find projects completed during my second year of university. These projects likely build upon the fundamentals and may showcase more advanced concepts and skills.

- **Year 3**: The third-year directory contains projects from the most recent academic year. These projects may demonstrate a deeper understanding of the subject matter and a higher level of proficiency.

## Projects

Each year's directory is further subdivided into individual project folders. Within these project folders, you will find detailed documentation, source code, and any additional resources related to each project. Feel free to explore these projects to gain insights into my academic journey and the topics I've explored.

Thank you for visiting my GitHub repository and taking the time to explore my university projects. I hope you find them insightful and inspiring!
