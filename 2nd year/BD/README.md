# Intelligent Vending Machines Database Project

## Introduction

This repository contains the database project for "Intelligent Vending Machines" (IVM) in accordance with the requirements of a relational database course. The project is divided into two main parts: Part 2 and Part 3.

## Part 2 - Relational Model

In the second part of the project, our objective is to design the relational model corresponding to a proposed solution for the Entity-Relationship (E-A) model in the domain of Intelligent Vending Machines (IVM). This involves converting the conceptual E-A model into a structured relational database model.

### Tasks in Part 2

1. Design the Relational Model: Create the tables and define their attributes, primary keys, and relationships based on the E-A model.
2. Develop Relational Queries: Write relational algebra and SQL queries to interact with the relational model.
3. Document the Relational Model: Provide an overview of the tables, their attributes, and the purpose of each table in the README.md.

## Part 3 - Advanced SQL and Application Development

The third part of the project involves advanced SQL development, complex integrity constraints, creation of a web application prototype, and OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) queries.

### Tasks in Part 3

1. Advanced SQL Queries: Develop complex SQL queries to address specific data retrieval and manipulation requirements.
2. Complex Integrity Constraints: Implement advanced integrity constraints to ensure data consistency and accuracy.
3. Web Application Prototype: Create a prototype of a web application that interacts with the database, showcasing its functionality.
4. OLAP Queries: Write OLAP queries to perform multidimensional analysis on the data.

## Grading

Grade -> 19.68

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- `sql_queries/`: Contains SQL queries for both Part 2 and Part 3.
- `web_app/`: Contains the prototype of the web application.
- `documentation/`: Contains documentation related to the project.
- `data_model/`: Includes the relational data model and schemas.
