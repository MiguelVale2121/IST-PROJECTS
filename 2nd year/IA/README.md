## 1. Introduction
Welcome to the Takuzu Solver project! This project is part of the Artificial Intelligence (AI) course curriculum and aims to develop a Python program that solves the Takuzu puzzle using AI search techniques.

## 2. Problem Description
Takuzu, also known as Binairo, Binary Puzzle, Sudoku Binary, or Tic-Tac-Logic, is a logic puzzle that has two possible origins, both in 2009: Tohu wa Vohu was invented by Italian Adolfo Zanellati, and Binairo was created by Belgians Peter De Schepper and Frank Coussement.

The Takuzu game is played on a square grid. Each cell of the grid can contain either a 0 or a 1.

Given a grid with an N Ã— N layout, partially filled with 0s and 1s, the objective of Takuzu is to fill the entire grid with 0s and 1s following these rules:
- There is an equal number of 1s and 0s in each row and column (or one more for grids with an odd dimension).
- No more than two identical numbers are adjacent to each other (horizontally or vertically).
- All rows are different.
- All columns are different.

The initial content of the grid positions cannot be changed.

It can be assumed that a Takuzu instance has a unique solution.

## 3. Objective
The objective of this project is to develop a Python 3.8 program that, given a Takuzu instance, returns a solution, i.e., a fully filled grid.
