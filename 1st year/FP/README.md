# FP Projects

This repository contains two projects that I completed as part of my Fundamentos da Programação course. These projects are implemented in Python and involve creating programs to play two different board games: Jogo do Galo (Tic-Tac-Toe) and Jogo do Moinho (Nine Men's Morris).

## Jogo do Galo (Tic-Tac-Toe)

In this first project for Fundamentos da Programação, I developed a Python program that allows a human player to play the classic game of Jogo do Galo (Tic-Tac-Toe) against the computer. The objective of the game is to get three of your symbols (X or O) in a row, column, or diagonal. The computer opponent is designed to provide a challenging gaming experience.

### Features
- Human vs. computer gameplay.
- A well-implemented game logic.
- A user-friendly interface.

### Project Grade
My grade for this project was 17.7.

### How to Play Jogo do Galo
To play Jogo do Galo, you can use the following Python code:

```python
# Play Jogo do Galo (Tic-Tac-Toe) with player "X" and difficulty "normal"
result_galo = jogo_do_galo("X", "normal")
print("Result of Jogo do Galo:", result_galo)
```

## Jogo do Moinho (Nine Men's Morris)

In this second project for Fundamentos da Programação, I developed a Python program that allows a human player to play the strategic board game Jogo do Moinho (Nine Men's Morris) against the computer. The game involves placing nine pieces on the board and strategically moving them to form mills (three pieces in a row), which allows the player to remove one of the opponent's pieces. The objective is to either reduce the opponent's pieces to two or make it impossible for them to make a move.

### Features
- Human vs. computer gameplay.
- Strategic game logic.
- An intuitive interface.

### Project Grade
My grade for this project was 14.6.

### How to Play Jogo do Moinho
To play Jogo do Moinho, you can use the following Python code:

```python
# Play Jogo do Moinho (Nine Men's Morris) with player "[X]" and difficulty "dificil"
result_moinho = moinho("[X]", "dificil")
print("Result of Jogo do Moinho:", result_moinho)
```
