# Programming Logic - Kakuro Solver Project

This project aims to develop a PROLOG program to solve Kakuro puzzles.

## Project Description

A Kakuro puzzle consists of an n Ã— m grid (n rows, m columns). Each grid position can be empty or contain a backslash "\", flanked by zero, one, or two integers. The objective is to fill the grid according to specific rules so that the sum of numbers in each row and column matches the specified values.

## Features

- Kakuro puzzle solving.
- Automatic Kakuro grid filling.
- Validation of Kakuro solutions.

## Requirements

- [PROLOG](https://www.swi-prolog.org/)

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local environment.
2. Run the PROLOG program with the provided code.
