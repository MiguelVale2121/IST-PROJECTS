## Overview

Nave Guardi√£ Mineradora is a project that explores the fundamentals of Computer Architecture, including assembly language programming, working with peripherals, and handling interrupts. The primary objective of this project is to create a simulation game featuring a spaceship that mines asteroids while defending itself against enemy ships. The game interface includes a screen, a keyboard for control, and a set of displays to show the spaceship's energy level.
